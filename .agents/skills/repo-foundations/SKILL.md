description: Core repository conventions and workflow for this Bun monorepo. Use when adding or modifying code and you need project structure, style rules, command workflow, env patterns, or quick location lookup.

# Repo Foundations

Use this skill for baseline repo conventions before implementation.

## What To Load

- Project structure and imports: `references/project-structure.md`
- File-location lookup: `references/quick-reference.md`
- Mandatory dos and don'ts: `references/important-guidelines.md`
- Code formatting and naming: `references/code-style.md`
- Build/test/lint/db commands and CI flow: `references/development-workflow.md`
- Env schema and validation patterns: `references/environment-variables.md`

## Workflow

1. Read `references/important-guidelines.md` first.
2. Use `references/quick-reference.md` and `references/project-structure.md` to place files correctly.
3. Follow `references/code-style.md` and `references/environment-variables.md` while implementing.
4. Validate with commands from `references/development-workflow.md`.
